## Profile  
I am an aspiring Data Engineer with a strong foundation in network operations and a passion for software and data engineering. Currently pursuing a degree in Data Engineering, I am committed to expanding my skills in cloud computing, data management, and analytics to transition into a data-focused role. My previous experience as a NOC Engineer has equipped me with strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and technical proficiency, all of which I am eager to apply in the field of data engineering.

## Projects  

### Weather Data Collection and Management  
**Description:** Developed a comprehensive weather data collection and management system using APIs from SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) and OpenWeatherMap. The project involved obtaining API keys, fetching real-time weather data, and storing it systematically while ensuring data integrity.

- **Key Features:**
  - **API Integration:** Integrated with SMHI and OpenWeatherMap APIs to retrieve weather data such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
  - **Data Storage:** Implemented a system to store and update weather records while avoiding duplicate entries, ensuring accurate historical weather data for specific towns and regions.
  - **Data Management:** Designed logic to maintain the records, ensuring consistent updates without redundancy, crucial for accurate data tracking over time.
  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, RESTful APIs, SQL, Data Management Techniques.

This project enhanced my skills in API integration, data management, and handling real-time data, laying a strong foundation for more complex data engineering tasks.

### Simulated E-commerce Application with Real-time Data Processing  
**Description:** Developed a simulated e-commerce application focusing on real-time data processing and management using Apache Kafka. The project involved simulating the sale of e-commerce products and streaming orders to Kafka, followed by multiple consumers processing this data for various analytical purposes.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Order Simulation:** Created a program that simulates the sale of e-commerce items, streaming orders in real-time to Apache Kafka.
  - **Real-time Analytics:** Developed multiple Kafka consumers with specific purposes:
    - **Consumer 1:** Tracks the total number of orders received from midnight to the current time.
    - **Consumer 2:** Provides insights into daily sales totals and sales within the last hour.
    - **Consumer 3:** Generates a daily sales report at midnight, detailing the number of orders, total sales, and product-wise sales for the day, saved to a file with the day's date.
    - **Consumer 4:** Updates product inventory in real-time as sales occur, ensuring accurate stock levels.
  - **Advanced Order Management (VG level):** Implemented an order handling system where each order has a percentage chance of being processed. Processed orders trigger a simulated email notification to the customer, with the order marked as handled in a separate Kafka topic. Monitoring was set up to track the number of processed orders over various time intervals (e.g., last 5 minutes, last hour).
  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Apache Kafka, Data Streaming, Real-time Analytics, File Handling.

This project provided hands-on experience with real-time data processing, event-driven architecture, and managing data streams, all of which are essential skills in data engineering.
